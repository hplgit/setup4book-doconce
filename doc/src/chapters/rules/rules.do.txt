This ${CHAPTER} describes the file structure of book projects.
The setup can of course be used for proceedings and theses as well.

!split
======= Directory structure =======
label{sec:rules:dir:struct}

We shall outline a directory structure that can be effective when
assembling different DocOnce documents into a book:

!bc
doc
  src
    chapters
      ch2
        fig-ch2
        src-ch2
        mov-ch2
        exer-ch2
    book
  pub
    chapters
    book
  web
!ec

The root directory for all documentation is called `doc`, with two
subdirectories: `src` for all the DocOnce source code, and `pub` for
compiled (published) documents in various formats. A third
subdirectory, `web`, is often present as an entry point for the web
pages on GitHub. This directory typically contains the autogenerated
`index.html` and additional style files on GitHub. The `index.html`
file should have links to published documents in `../pub`.

Under `doc/src` we may have a directory `chapters` for
the individual chapters and a directory `book` for the assembly into
a book. One may also think of more than one book directory if a set
of documents (chapters) naturally leads to multiple books. All
chapters can then be put in the `chapters` directory.

Each chapter has a short *nickname*, say `ch2` for simplicity
for Chapter 2 (a more descriptive name related to the content is obviously
much better!). Figures are placed in subdirectory `fig-ch2` and
computer code in subdirectory `src-ch2`.
These two latter directories may have subdirectories if desired.
We may also include a directory `mov-ch2` for video files, `exer-ch2` for
answers to exercises, etc.

Under `book`, we typically have a document `book.do.txt` for the complete
book. This is a file with a lot of `# #include "...do.txt"`
statements for the Preprocess preprocessor for
including the files for the various chapters, see Section
ref{setup:rules:book:assembly} for details. Additional files
in the `book` directory include make files for compiling the book,
scripts for packing the book for publishing, perhaps an errata document, etc.


!split
======= Newcommands =======

Files with names `newcommands*.tex` are by DocOnce treated as files
with definition of newcommands for LaTeX mathematics.
These files must reside in the same
directory as the DocOnce source files. However, for a book project,
it is common to have one newcommands file shared by all chapters.
This file is placed
in `doc/src/chapters/newcommands.p.tex` and copied to a specific
chapter by the make script for that chapter. The extension of
the file is `.p.tex`, indicating that the file has to be
*preprocessed* by `preprocess` prior to being copied. The reason
is that one occasionally wants the definitions of the newcommands
to depend on the output format (standard LaTeX or MathJax).
For example, subscripts in `mbox` font look best with footnotesize
font in plain LaTeX, while the larger `small` font is more appropriate
for MathJax. We can then put the following definitions in
`newcommands.p.tex`:

!bc latexcod
%% #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
%% Use footnotesize in subscripts
\newcommand{\subsc}[2]{#1_{\mbox{\footnotesize #2}}}
%% #else
%% In MathJax, a different construction is used
\newcommand{\subsc}[2]{#1_{\small\mbox{#2}}}
%% #endif
!ec
## Note: need double %% above because single % is interpreted
## by mako as command... (doconce reports error for single %)
The make script will then run `preprocess` on this file,
typically

!bc shcod
preprocess -DFORMAT=pdflatex ../newcommands.p.tex > newcommands.tex
# or
preprocess -DFORMAT=html ../newcommands.p.tex > newcommands.tex
!ec

!bwarning DocOnce newcommands are for mathematics only!
Note that
newcommands in DocOnce context are only used for mathematics,
rendered by LaTeX or MathJax. Newcommands for other LaTeX constructions
(such as section or boxes) should not be used in the DocOnce source
code as these are confined
to the LaTeX format. Use instead Mako functions.

!split
======= Assembling different pieces to a book =======
label{setup:rules:book:assembly}

Many smaller writings in the DocOnce format can be assembled
into a single, large document such as a book or thesis.
The recipe for doing this appears below.

===== Organization of a chapter =====

Suppose one chapter) of the book
has the nickname `ch2` and may hold all text or just include
text in other DocOnce files, e.g., `part1.do.txt`, `part2.do.txt`, and
`part3.do.txt`. In this latter case, `ch2.do.txt` has
the simple content

@@@CODE src-rules/ch2.do.txt

## Note: ch2.do.txt contains preprocess commands so we cannot just
## put it into !bc do ... !ec environment here because then preprocess
## will try to do the fake includes... That is why we copy code from file.

Note that the `ch2.do.txt` file contains just plain text without
any `TITLE`, `AUTHOR`, or `DATE` lines and without any
table of contents (`TOC`) and bibliography (`BIBITEM`).
This property makes `ch2.do.txt`
suitable for being including in other documents like a book.
However, to compile `ch2.do.txt` to a stand-alone document,
we normally want a title, an author,
a date, and perhaps a table of contents.
We also want a bibliography if any of the included files has
`cite` tags. To this end, we create a wrapper file, say
`main_ch2.do.txt`[^name-main],
with the content

@@@CODE src-rules/main_ch2.do.txt

[^name-main]: The prefix `main_` is inspired by the main program
in computer program: those statements make a program run, like
`main_ch2.do.txt` defines the surroundings of the ``library text''
`ch2.do.txt`. We strip off `main_` when publishing the files in
`doc/pub`.

Recall that DocOnce relies on the Publish software for handling
bibliographies. It is easy to import from BibTeX to Publish and
create a database of references (`papers.pub`) to get started (but
we recommend to continue working with the
Publish database directly and collect new items in the `papers.pub` file
as Publish is more flexible than BibTeX).


===== Figures and source code =====

As described in Section ref{sec:rules:dir:struct}, we recommend to put
figures and source codes (to be included in the document) in separate
directories. Although such directories could have natural names like
`fig` and `src`, it will cause trouble if we do not use unique names
for these directories, like `fig-ch2` and `src-ch2`. Otherwise, we
would need to copy all figures in all pieces into a common `fig`
directory for the book and all source code files into a `src`
directory. With unique names, figures and source code files can always
reside in their original locations, and we can easily reach them
through links. This will be described next.

===== Assembly of chapters to a book =====

All the files associated with the `ch2` document and chapter reside
in the `ch2` directory. A fundamental principle of DocOnce is to
have just one copy of the files (``document once!'').
To include the `ch2` text in a larger document like a book, we just
need to include the `ch2.do.txt` file and a chapter heading.
Here is an example of a document `book.do.txt` for a complete book:

@@@CODE src-rules/book.do.txt

When running `doconce format` on `book.do.txt`, the entire document
is contained in *one* big file[^one-file] (!).
To see exactly what has been included,
you can examine the result of running the first preprocessor, `preprocess`,
on `book.do.txt`. All the includes are handled by this preprocessor.
The result is contained in the file
`tmp_preprocess__book.do.txt`, which then contains the entire
DocOnce source code of the book. The second preprocessor, `mako`, is thereafter
run (if DocOnce detects that it is necessary).
The result of that step is available in
`tmp_mako__book.do.txt`. It is important to examine this file if there
are problems with Mako variables or functions.
The `tmp_mako__book.do.txt` file is thereafter translated to
the desired output format.

[^one-file]: A single DocOnce file and consequently a single
`.tex` file works out well on today's laptops.
A book with 900 pages cite{Langtangen_2014} has been tested!

Say we want to produce a LaTeX document:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pdflatex book [options]
!ec
If the DocOnce source contains copying of source code from files in
`@@@CODE` constructs, it is important that `doconce` finds the files.
For example,

!bc do
@@@CODE src-ch2/myprog.py  fromto: def test1@def test2
!ec
will try to open the file `src-ch2/myprog.py`. Since this file is
actually located in `../ch2/src-ch2/myprog.py`, `pdflatex` will
report an error message. A local link to
that directory resolves the problem:

!bc sys
Terminal> ln -s ../chapters/ch2/src-ch2 src-ch2
!ec
Similarly,
the LaTeX code in `book.tex` for inclusion of a figure may
contain

!bc latexcod
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewith]{fig-ch2/fig1.pdf}
!ec
For this command to work, it is paramount that there is a link `fig-ch2` in the
present `book` directory where the `pdflatex` command is run to
the directory `../chapters/ch2/fig-ch2` where the figure file `fig1.pdf` is
located.

It is recommended to use the function `make_links` in `scripts.py` to
automatically set up all convenient links from the `book` directory
to the individual chapter directories. Provided the *list of chapter nicknames*
at the top of `scripts.py` *is correct*, you can just run

!bc pyshell
>>> import scripts
>>> scripts.make_links()
!ec
to automatically
set up all links to all `src-*`, `fig-*`, and `mov-*` directories.
You need to rerun this `make_links` function after inclusion of a new chapter
in the `chapters` tree.

!bwarning Identify LaTeX errors in the original chapter files!
When you run `pdflatex book` and get LaTeX errors, you need
to see where they are in `book.tex` and use this information to
find the appropriate DocOnce source file in some chapter.
Usually, there are few errors at the ``book level'' if each individual
chapter has been compiled. To this end, you can use `scripts.py` to
automatically compile each chapter separately. The process is stopped
as soon as a DocOnce or LaTeX error is encountered.

!bc pyshell
>>> import scripts
>>> scripts.compile_chapters()
!ec
!ewarning

With heavy use of Mako one can get quite strange error messages.
Some ask you to rerun the `doconce format` command with
`--mako_strict_undefined` to see undefined Mako variables.
Make sure you run the `make.sh` script by `bash -x` if the script
does not feature the `set -x` command in the top of the file
(for displaying a command prior to running it). Copy the complete
`doconce format` with the mouse and add the `--mako_strict_undefined`
option.
Other error messages point to specific lines
that Mako struggles with. Go to the file `tmp_mako__book.do.txt`
to investigate the line.

===== HTML/Sphinx versions of the book =====

It is easy to make a standard HTML version of the `book.do.txt` manuscript, but
for large books, Sphinx is usually a better alternative since it supports
navigation, searching, and has an index. There is a script `make_rs.sh`
that creates a Sphinx version of the book. Actually, it generates two
versions

 * standard Sphinx book
 * "RunestoneInteractive": "http://runestoneinteractive.org" Sphinx book


!split
======= Tools =======

You can start a new, future, potential book project by simply copying
the directory structure of the "setup4book-doconce": "https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce" repository on GitHub. Then you can follow
the instructions below to start writing and adapting the structure to
your project's needs.


===== Making a new chapter =====

Under `doc/src/chapters`
you find the chapters in this ``sample book'' as well as a script
`doc/chapters/mkdir.sh` that creates a new directory for you with the
typical files needed for a new chapter. You can either edit existing
chapters, or make a brand new empty chapter by running

!bc sys
Terminal> sh mkdir.sh mychap
!ec
This command makes
a directory `mychap` for a new chapter with nickname `mychap`.
Files from the `template` directory are used to populate `mychap`. You get
an empty `mychap.do.txt` where the text is supposed to go, or this file
can just include a series of smaller `.do.txt` files, and you get the
wrapper file `main_mychap.do.txt` such that you can compile this chapter
as a stand-alone document. You also get `make.sh` which calls `../make.sh`
with the chapter main document (`main_mychap`) as argument. Optional
arguments for running `doconce format pdflatex` can be given to
`../make.sh` in `make.sh` if needed (e.g., --encoding=utf8`).

===== Compiling the chapter =====

=== PDF ===

To make a stand-alone document of a chapter, by compiling to LaTeX and PDF,
we propose the convention to have a `make.sh` in each chapter directory.
This `make.sh` can in most cases just call up a common `../make.sh`
script,

!bc shpro
bash -x ../make.sh main_mychap
!ec
or optionally with some command-line arguments,

!bc shpro
bash -x ../make.sh main_mychap --encoding=utf-8
!ec
The `doc/src/chapters/make.sh` script is quite general and may be edited
according to your layout preferences of the LaTeX documents.

The present `make.sh` script creates two PDF files: one for printing and
one for electronic viewing. The difference is that all URLs in the
version for printing appear as footnotes (and just hyperlinks with
a dark blue color in the electronic version). The two files are
named `mychap.pdf` and `mychap-4print.pdf`, respectively, and
copied to `doc/pub/mychap/pdf` for publishing.


__Remark.__
The suggested `make.sh` file
applies the `--latex_code_style=` option to `doconce format`
for specifying the typesetting of blocks of computer code in LaTeX.
Originally, DocOnce applied the `ptex2tex` program to select such
typesetting, but the new method is more flexible and simpler (in that
it gives cleaner LaTeX code). (With `ptex2tex` one would need a common
configuration file `doc/chapters/.ptex2tex.cfg` to be copied by
`doc/chapters/make.sh` to the chapter directory prior to running
`ptex2tex.)

=== HTML ===

There is also a script `doc/src/chapters/make_html.sh` for making
HTML versions of the chapter. Just call this as

!bc sys
Terminal> bash ../make_html.sh main_mychap
!ec
to make HTML versions of the `mychap` chapter.

The current version of `make_html.sh` creates four types of HTML
layouts and an `index.html` file with a list of links to these three files:
1) HTML plain Bootstrap style, 2) HTML Bootswatch readable style,
3) plain HTML solarized color style, and 4) Sphinx pyramid style.
(Note that the latter document is a true Sphinx document,
made by `doconce format sphinx`, and from which one
could make other formats too.)

It is easy to go into the `make_html.sh` script and generate other
HTML or Sphinx styles.

!bwarning You need to edit the index file!
The `index.html` file generated by `make_html.sh` is made from the
DocOnce source file `index_html_files.do.txt`. This is a
file utilizing Mako programming
(see refch[${APPENDIX} ref{ch:mako}][cite{Langtangen_dobook_mako}][
the document "Use of Mako to aid book writing":
"http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/mako"].
There is also a similar file, `index_files.do.txt`, listing all
the published documents in various formats associated with a complete
book projects (to go to `doc/pub/index.html`).

In the `index_html_files.do.txt` file, we define a Mako dictionary
`chapters` mapping nicknames to chapter titles. This dict makes it easy
to compile `index_html_files.do.txt` with a Mako variable `CHAPTER`
set to the chapter nickname and get a tailored `index.html` file
for the HTML versions of that chapter. Similarly,
`index_files.do.txt` also has a `chapters` dict and an associated
`published` list with all the nicknames of the chapters that we want
to list in the overview of the entire book project (all sufficiently
finished chapters).

The `index_files.do.txt` file gives a table of contents of all documents,
so you will normally compile this manually now and then as

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html index_files --html_style=bootstrap \
          --html_links_in_new_window --html_bootstrap_navbar=off
!ec
and publish it in `doc/pub/index.html`.
!ewarning

=== Cleaning Files ===

The `make*.sh` files generate a lot of files that can easily
be regenerated and that are normally removed from the chapter
directories. The script `sh ../clean.sh` can be run in any
chapter directory to clean up redundant files.

===== About figures when publishing HTML =====

There will be `<img src=fig-ch2/fig1.png>` type of tags in HTML code
produced by DocOnce, so it is very important to ensure that the
*published* `.html` files have access to a subdirectory
`fig-ch2`. Normally, one needs to copy `fig-ch2` from the `ch2`
chapter source directory to some publishing directory that stores all
the files necessary for accessing the entire HTML document on the web.

===== Compiling the book =====

Go to `doc/src/book` and run `make.sh` to compile the book. This requires
that `book.do.txt` performs the right include of chapters, table of
contents, and bibliography.

There are many other tools in `doc/src/book` too, e.g., the mentioned
library of handy scripts in `scripts.py`, and an example on how to
pack all files of the entire book projects for publishing with Springer
(`pack_Springer.sh`).

The current book layout created by `make.sh` makes use of a (now outdated)
Springer T2 style for textbooks (requires the `.cls` and `.sty` files in
the `book` directory). Other Springer styles supported by DocOnce
are Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering (monographs
and proceedings),
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (proceedings), and Undergraduate Texts
in Physics. Other book styles will require some manual work, either
working out a LaTeX preamble for a special style and use that when
compiling `book.do.txt` or actually extending the DocOnce source code.

!split
======= Cross-referencing across chapters =======

A fundamental problem when writing a book *and* stand-alone chapters
arises with cross-referencing. In a book file it makes sense to refer
to an equation in any chapter, say (4.23), while in a stand-alone
chapter references to equations or sections in other stand-alone
documents will not work. That is, LaTeX has a native mechanism for
this, the `xr` package, where one can register a set of `.aux` files
for other LaTeX documents and refer directly to these labels and get
them right. It is then possible to write something like

!bc latex
see (\eqref{sec:results:u:eq}) in \cite{Hansen_2011b}
!ec
and get it out as

!bc
see (2.37) in [12]
!ec
provided our `.tex` file contains `\externaldocument{myother}`
and the label `sec:results:u:eq` is defined in `myother.aux`. DocOnce
has generalized this feature so it works for non-LaTeX formats as well.
It is called *generalized cross-references*. You can then write
such references across chapters and get all labels right whether you
produce the entire book or individual chapters.


===== Syntax of generalized cross-references =====

Here is an example on a generalized reference to an equation in another
${CHAPTER}:

!bc do
The world's most famous equation is ref[(ref{fake:Emc2})][in
cite{Langtangen_dobook_fake}][
as found in the document "Some document":
"http://hplgit.gthub.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/fake"
cite{Langtangen_dobook_fake}].
!ec
This sentence is rendered as follows in the present format (`${FORMAT}`):

!bbox
The world's most famous equation is ref[(ref{fake:Emc2})][in
cite{Langtangen_dobook_fake}][
as found in the document "Some document":
"http://hplgit.gthub.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/fake"
cite{Langtangen_dobook_fake}].
!ebox

More detailed information about generalized cross-references is
found in the "DocOnce manual": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#generalized-cross-referencing".
In particular, one has to insert `# Externaldocuments:` commands in
all `main_*.do.txt` files that includes files with generalized
references.

!split
======= Study guides and slides =======

DocOnce has good support for creating slides from ordinary documents
with running text. Rather than speaking about slides, we think of
*study guides* where the material is presented in a very condensed,
effective, summarizing form for overview, use in lectures, and
repetition. The slide format is a good way of writing study guides,
but by explicitly thinking of study guides the slide format can be
made more effective for self-study when overview and repetition are
necessary - with a particular emphasis on gaining understanding.

It is, of course, a very challenging balance between enough
information for self-study by reading slides and overwhelmingly much
text and information in slides for oral presentations. Text must
anyway be minimized all the way on slides, and the reader of a study
guide is supposed to also be a reader of the underlying running text
in the chapter.

===== Slide directory =====

For each DoOnce file in the chapter `ch2` it can be wise to make a
corresponding study guide file in the subdirectory `slides-ch2`.
For example, `part1.do.txt` has its counterpart with slides in
`slides-ch2/part1.do.txt`. Then there is a file `slides_ch2.do.txt`
which assembles the parts if `slides-ch2`, typically with a content
like

@@@CODE src-rules/slides_ch2.do.txt

===== Generating slides from running text =====

The author has the following work flow for generating slides for a
chapter file, say `part1.do.txt`.

 o Copy `part1.do.txt` to `slides-ch2/part1.do.txt`.
 o Make `slides_ch2.do.txt` and include `slides-ch2/part1.do.txt`.
 o Decide on *parts* of the slide collection. Often a part can be
   a section in the parent `ch2.do.txt` file, but sometimes it can
   be more natural to have larger parts than sections in the slide
   collection.
 o Each part in the slide file has a DocOnce section heading  with 7 `=`, while
   each slide has a DocOnce subsection heading with 5 `=`.
 o Edit `slides-ch2/part1.do.txt`:
   * One can keep subsection headings from the running text for the most part,
     but slides need many more subsection headings.
   * Try to let the heading summarize explicitly a conclusion/rule from
     the slide (the slide table of contents is then a set of conclusions/rules!)
   * Remember a `!split` right above very slide heading!
   * Compile frequently and look at the slides: they become over-full very
     quickly so there is a constant need for dividing slides into new
     ones with new headings.
   * Read a paragraph, focus on its main idea and result, and see how it
     can be condensed to one sentence or a few bullet points.
     *Making effective slides is the art of condensing the most
     important information in the text to a eye-catching format.*
   * Do not remove figures without a very good reason. Figures are important!
   * Add new images to live up the presentation. In slides you may think of
     cartoons or entertaining images that would never be suitable
     in a chapter/book, but they may help attract attention,
     communicate ideas, and enhance the memory process.
   * Condense every mathematical derivation. Make sure the goal and end
     result is clear before diving into details.
   * Detailed derivations are seldom of interest in a study guide or
     oral presentation - refer to the underlying running text in the
     chapter for the details. Focus on ideas and key mathematical steps (if they
     are important enough).
   * Remember that equations are sometimes excellent images for ideas!
     Complicated equations can therefore be important slide elements
     although the details will never be addressed.
   * It is quite often wise to remove equation numbers in slides.
     You can automatically remove them by `--denumber_all_equations`, or
     you can edit the LaTeX math environment manually.
     Remember that
     references to equations numbers must be removed from the slides too!
   * Movies are effective in slides. It is still a hassle to get them
     displayed correctly in PDF files, so using a test on `FORMAT` and
     writing `MOVIE` for HTML output and just a link in PDF output
     might be necessary. See the "manual": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#movies" for how to work with movies in DocOnce.

The slides are to fulfill three purposes:

 o reading as a study guide to get overview before reading the
   full text of chapter,
 o watching as slides during an oral presentation,
 o reading as a study guide to repeat and enforce overview of the material.

It is highly non-trivial to meet all these purposes: limit the
information on the slides, make them as visual as *feasible*, make them
self contained, and provide the *sufficient* amount of
information. Considerable iterations are always needed. Reading the
slides as a study guide is easy to accomplish. The slides' properties
in live presentations can only be tested by speaking to them (making a
rough draft of a video podcast is a very effective way of testing
the slides' quality).

===== Compiling slides =====

There is a quite general script in `doc/src/chapters/make_slides.sh` for
compiling a slide collection defined in a file like `slides_ch2.do.txt`.
Just run

!bc sys
Terminal> bash ../make_slides.sh slides_ch2
!ec
from the chapter directory. Note that the script will first spell check
the slide files. This is done in the `slides-ch2` directory. Errors are
reported in files located in `slides-ch2`. To update the chapter's dictionary
for spell checking, you need to do

!bc sys
Terminal> cp slides-ch2/new_dictionary.txt~ .dict4spell
!ec
in the `ch2` chapter directory.

Similarly, to look at misspellings,
the file `slides-ch2/misspellings.txt~` is the relevant file.

The `make_slides.sh` script compiles a variety of slides:

 * First a plain LaTeX PDF document to catch as many errors in the
   DocOnce source as early as possible. This document can also be
   used for compact printing of the contents of the study guide
   (and the output looks definitely like a study guide and not slides!).
 * HTML5 `reveal.js` slides with different colors.
 * HTML5 `deck.js` slides. This format is usually inferior to `reveal.js`,
   but is also very much personal taste.
 * LaTeX Beamer slides. Edit the `theme=red_shadow` line in `make_slides.sh`
   to control the Beamer theme.
 * Remark (Markdown) slides for viewing in a browser.

===== IPython/Jupyter notebooks =====

Since DocOnce documents can be translated to IPython/Jupyter notebooks,
hereafter just called notebooks, it is tempting to produce a version
of the teaching material also in notebook form. This author's experience
is that a more traditional book format with running text is not so
ideal for a notebook:

 * you simply get too much text in a too long notebook,
 * the notebook needs more code snippets than what you want to show in
   a book (or you just want to show fragments while the notebook requires
   complete code),
 * there are many cross-references between equations, sections, figures,
   and running text that the notebook does not support well.

Instead, making slides from the chapter's text and translating slides
to the notebook format is a splendid idea. This requires some tuning,
as you want slight differences between classic slides and a notebook.
For example, a code snippet that results with a plot should contain
the plot in classic slides, while the notebook will automatically
produce it when run. This is easily fixed by an if test in Mako,
typically `% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':` followed by a `FIGURE:` line
that includes the resulting figure for all formats except the notebook.

Also be aware of the DocOnce *hidden* code environment that can
be used to declare code blocks that appear in notebooks (because they
are needed) but not in other formats: `!bc pyhid` gives a Python
hidden snippet.

Using notebooks as a starting point for a traditional textbook might be
a good idea, but will enforce a non-conventional style in the textbook.
For example, notebooks should be quite small, leading to similarly
small modules in the book. Notebooks use cross-referencing to little
extent, and this will be reflected in the textbook too. Notebooks also
need more code to run, so one has to accept more code in the textbook.
However, there is still a problem for the notebook with defining items
for an index, fancy admonitions, and other elements that one would
desire in a textbook. More experience is needed to make best practices.
Since notebooks can be compiled Markdown, and DocOnce can read
basic Markdown input, it is possible to go from the notebook format
to DocOnce, but this is not tested.

!bnotice Remark
More best practices from turning teaching material in
books into notebooks are supposed to be collected here in the future.

======= Writing in private repository while publishing in public =======

Sometimes you want to keep ongoing writing in a *private* repository
and make only *selected* chapters and/or files publicly visible.
In such cases
one can set up the book project structure in a private repository, but
use a public repository instead of the `doc/pub` directory for publishing
selected compiled documents. This is easy: just change the `dest=`
line, where the publishing directory is defined, in all `make*.sh`
scripts in `doc/src/chapters`. The files will then be copied to
this alternative destination.

Often, you want to publish the software associated with the book
project, stored in `doc/src/chapter/nickname/src-nickname`, as a part
of the public repository. Such files can also easily be copied, say to
`src/nickname` in the public repository. However, software files often
change names and locations in subdirectories, and then you need to be
very careful with updating the Git commands in the public repository
every time you do `git add` or `git rm` locally in the private
repository.  This problem occurs with text files too, but maybe less
often, so the recipe given below applies to all kind of files you want
to mirror from a private to a public repository.

We have made a script "`rsync_git.py`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce/tree/master/doc/src/chapters/rules/src-rules/rsync_git.py"
that can copy files from one repository to another and log files that
are removed or deleted and then take the appropriate Git actions.
Running

!bc sys
Terminal> rsync_git.py src-mychap $HOME/repos/pub/mybook/src/mychap
!ec
will copy all files from `src-mychap` to `$HOME/repos/pub/mybook/src/mychap`,
find which files that are new in `src-mychap` and
must be added to the destination directory, and which files
that are removed in `src-mychap` and should be removed in the destination
directory as well.
An `rsync` command is run to the physical copy and removal of
files, followed by `git add` and `git rm`
commands. In this way, you can automatically keep the public repository
as a mirror *of parts* of your private repository![^rsync-git]

[^rsync-git]: This functionality should be a part of Git, but no Git expert I have talked to has ever seen use for merging a flexibly defined subset of a repository with another repository. (The current functionality of Git is not capable of working with, e.g., branches that merge with only parts of another branch.)

The `rsync_git.py` script is listed below for reference. Note that
a file `$HOME/.rsyncexclude` can be made to filter out certain files
that you never want to copy (this is always a good idea!).
