This document describes the work flow and how we can utilize many
nice DocOnce features when writing chapters for a future, potential book
project.

======= Use of variables =======

idx{variables in mako}
idx{mako!variables}

Mako is the preprocessor that is always run prior to translating DocOnce
documents into a specific format. It means that your DocOnce source is
actually a computer program where you can use variables and functions.

Writing chapters that can both live their individual lives and be part of
a book faces some challenges for which we have some nice solutions
in the coming sections.

===== How to speak about ``this chapter'' =====

idx{`CHAPTER`}
idx{`BOOK`}
idx{`APPENDIX`}

In a book you will often need the phrase ``this chapter'', but his is
inappropriate if the chapter is a stand-alone document. Then you would
rather say ``this document''. Similarly, ``this book'' must read
``this document'' in a stand-alone chapter.
We have resolved this issue by introducing
Mako variables `CHAPTER`, `BOOK`, and `APPENDIX` such that you
write

!bc do
In this ${BOOK}, the convention is to use boldface for vectors.
!ec
For this to work, you need to define `CHAPTER`, `BOOK`, and `APPENDIX`
as variables on the command line as part of the `doconce format` command:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pdflatex ch2 --latex_code_style=pyg \
          CHAPTER=document BOOK=document APPENDIX=document
!ec
When the book is compiled, you do

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pdflatex ch2 --latex_code_style=pyg \
          CHAPTER=chapter BOOK=chapter APPENDIX=appendix
!ec
The `make*.sh` files found in `doc/src/chapter/` and
`doc/src/book` make proper definitions of
`CHAPTER`, `BOOK`, and `APPENDIX`.

!split
======= How to make several variants of the text =======

idx{if tests in mako}
idx{boolean in mako}
idx{mako!if tests}
idx{mako!boolean}

Sometimes you want to write some text slightly differently if the
chapter is a stand-alone document compared to the case when it is
part of a book. Mako if tests are ideal for this. Suppose you
introduce a Mako variable `ALONE` that is true/defined if the chapter
is a stand-alone document and false/undefined if part of a book. Then
you can simply write

!bc pycod
In this
% if ALONE:
rather small
% else:
large
% endif
${BOOK}
!ec
Running `doconce format` with the option `-DALONE` will turn `ALONE` to
true and the output is typically

!bc
In this rather small document
!ec
while for a book we skip `-DALONE` as argument to `doconce format`,
which makes `ALONE` undefined, and we
get the output

!bc
In this large book
!ec

Mako variables can be defined/undefined (boolean variables) or be
standard strings:

!bc pycod
% if SOME_STRING_VARIABLE in ('value1', 'value2'):
some running text
% endif

...

% if not SOME_BOOLEAN_VARIABLE:
some other running text
% else:
yet more different text
% endif
!ec

With Mako variables, you can easily comment out large portions
of text by testing on some variable you do not intend to define:

!bc pycod
% if EXTRA:
This is
text that
will never
appear in the
output.
% endif
!ec

Also, it is straightforward to write more than one version of a
chapter. For example, you may want to produce a version of a chapter
that is tailored to a specific course, while you for general publishing
on the Internet want a more general version, and maybe a third version
when the chapter is included in a book for the international market.
All this is easily done by if tests on appropriately defined Mako
variables

!bc pycod
% if COURSE == 'IT1713':
# Specific text for a course IT1713
...
% elif COURSE == 'IT1713b':
# Specific text for a the special IT1713b variant of the course
...
% elif COURSE == 'general':
# General text when the chapter is a stand-alone document
...
% elif COURSE == 'book1':
# Text when course is a part of a particular book
...
% elif COURSE == 'book2':
# Text when course is a part of another book
...
% endif
!ec

!split
======= Mako's Python functions =======

idx{functions in mako}
idx{mako!functions}

The if tests above are fine to handle larger portions of text. What if you
need to have four versions of just one word or very short text?
A Mako function, defined as a standard Python function,
is then more appropriate.

===== Basics of Mako functions =====

Here is a definition of a suitable Mako function, which must be
defined inside
`<%` and `%>` tags, using standard Python code:

@@@CODE src-mako/mako_func.py

In the running text you can call `chversion` with five arguments,
corresponding to the desired text in the five cases, and when `doconce format`
is run, the value of `COURSE` determines which of the five cases that is used.
Here is an example on DocOnce text with a function call to `chversion`:

!bc do
It is extremely important to define the term *cure* accurately.
Here we mean ${chversion('handle', 'handle',
'resolve', 'treat', 'resolve')}.
!ec
You can easily use long multi-line strings as arguments, e.g.,

!bc do
... ${chversion("""
Here comes
a multi-line
string""",
'short string',
'another short string',
"""4th
multi-line
string""",
'5th string')}
...
!ec

!bnotice There are two types of Mako functions
One type resembles Python functions, as demonstrated above. The other
type employs a slightly different syntax and is exemplified in the file
"`doc/src/chapters/index_files.do.txt`": "http://tinyurl.com/kukz8pt/index_files-do.txt". We refer to the "Mako syntax documentation": "http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/syntax.html" for more information.

===== How to treat multiple programming languages in the same text =====

With these ideas, it becomes straightforward to write a book that
has its program examples in multiple languages. Introduce `CODE`
as the name of the language and use if tests for larger portions
of code and text, and Mako functions for shorter inline texts,
to handle text that depends on the value of `CODE`.
The author has successfully co-written such a "book":
"http://hplgit.github.io/Programming-for-Computations/pub/p4c/index.html"
cite{Linge_Langtangen_2015}
for mathematical programming with either Python or Matlab - the version
is set when running `doconce format`.

Here is an example of text, in the style of the mention book,
where there are small differences
depending on the programming language:

!bc do
The following ${CODE} function `sampler` does the job
(see the file "${src('sampler')}":
"https://github.com/myuser/myproject/src/${src('sampler')}"):

${copyfile('sampler')}

Note that in ${CODE}, arrays start at index ${text2('0', '1')}.
Array slices like ${verb2('vec[2:8]', 'vec(2:7)')}
go from the first index (here `2`) up to
${text2('*but not including* the upper limit (here `8`)',
'(including) the upper limit (here `7`)'}.
% if CODE == 'Python':
Also note that the file `sampler.py` is a module, meaning
that we can call all the file's functions from other programs,
including `sampler_vec`.
% elif CODE == 'Matlab':
Also note that only the `sampler` function can be called
from other Matlab programs. If we want the alternative
implementation in function `sampler_vec` to be reused
by other programs, this function has to reside in a file
`sampler_vec.py`.
% endif
!ec

Here we have made use of a few Mako functions to easily
choose between a Python or Matlab relevant text:

 * `src` for picking a filename with the right extension (`.py` or `.m`)
 * `copyfile` for constructing the right `@@@CODE` line for a Python or
   Matlab source code file
 * `text2` for picking the first (Python) or second (Matlab) argument
 * `verb2` for picking the first (Python) or second (Matlab) argument typeset in
   inline verbatim font

The exact Mako code appears below.

!bc do
<%
def src(filestem, url=None, verb=True):
    """Return filstem plus .m or .py."""
    if CODE == "Python":
        filename = filestem + '.py'
    else:
        filename = filestem + '.m'
    if verb:
        filename = '`%s`' % filename
    if url is not None:
        # Make link to the file at github
        pass
    return filename

def copyfile(filestem, from_=None, to_=None):
    """Return @@@CODE line for copying a Python/Matlab file."""
    r = "@@@CODE "
    if CODE == "Python":
        r += "py-src/" + filestem + '.py'
    else:
        r += "m-src/" + filestem + '.m'
    if from_ is not None:
        r += ' fromto: ' + from_ + '@'
    if to_ is not None:
        r += to_
    return r

def verb2(py_expr, m_expr):
    """Return py_expr or m_expr in verbatim depending on CODE."""
    if CODE == "Python":
        expr = py_expr
    else:
        expr = m_expr
    expr = '`%s`' % expr
    return expr

def text2(py_expr, m_expr):
    """Return py_expr or m_expr depending on CODE."""
    if CODE == "Python":
        expr = py_expr
    else:
        expr = m_expr
    return expr

Compiling the document with

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc CODE=Python \
          --latex_code_style=pyg
!ec
results in the output

!bc
The following Python function \Verb!sampler! does the job
(see the file
\href{{https://github.com/myuser/myproject/src/`sampler.py`}}{
\nolinkurl{sampler.py}}):

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,
baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=2mm]{python}
"""Sampler module."""

def sampler(...):
    ...
\end{minted}

Note that in Python, arrays start at index 0.
Array slices like \Verb!vec[2:8]!
go from the first index (here \Verb!2!) up to
\emph{but not including} the upper limit (here \Verb!8!).
Also note that the file \Verb!sampler.py! is a module, meaning
that we can call all the file's functions from other programs,
including \Verb!sampler_vec!.
!ec
Switching to `CODE=Matlab` gives

!bc
The following Matlab function \Verb!sampler! does the job
(see the file
\href{{https://github.com/myuser/myproject/src/`sampler.m`}}{
\nolinkurl{sampler.m}}):

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,
baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=2mm]{matlab}
% Sampler code

function samples = sampler(...):
    ...
\end{minted}

Note that in Matlab, arrays start at index 1.
Array slices like \Verb!vec(2:7)!
go from the first index (here \Verb!2!) up to
(including) the upper limit (here \Verb!7!.
Also note that only the \Verb!sampler! function can be called
from other Matlab programs. If we want the alternative
implementation in function \Verb!sampler_vec! to be reused
by other programs, this function has to reside in a file
\Verb!sampler_vec.py!.
