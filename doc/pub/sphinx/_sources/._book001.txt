Preface
%%%%%%%

The purpose of this "book" is to demonstrate a minimalistic setup
for making books in the DocOnce format. The setup contains several
useful features:

1. Chapters can exist as stand-alone documents in different formats:

   * traditional LaTeX-style PDF report,

   * web pages with various fancy stylings (e.g., Sphinx, Bootstrap)
     and possibility for multi-media elements,

   * IPython notebooks,

   * blog posts (not exemplified here, but `straightforward <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#blog-posts>`__),

   * wiki (if you do not need mathematical typesetting).

2. Chapters can be flexibly assembled into a traditional LaTeX-based
   PDF book for a traditional publisher, or a fancy ebook.

3. The book and the individual chapter documents may have different
   layouts.

4. Active use of preprocessors (Preprocess and Mako) makes it
   easy to have different versions of the chapters,
   e.g., a specialized version for a course and
   a general version for the world book market).

5. DocOnce has support for important elements in teaching material:
   eye-catching boxes (admonitions), quizzes, interactive code,
   videos, structured exercises, quotes.

6. Study guides or slides can easily be developed from the running
   text and stored along with the chapters. These can be published
   as LaTeX Beamer slides, reveal.js slides, and IPython notebooks.

These features have the great advantage that a book can evolve from
small documents, thereby making the barrier for book writing much smaller.
Also, several appealing ebook formats can be produced, both for the
book and the individual chapter documents. The chances that your students
read a chapter on the bus becomes larger if the chapter is available
as attractive, screen-fit Bootstrap pages on the smart phone than if you
just offer the classic LaTeX PDF which actually requires a big screen or a
printer.

Implementation of point 1 and 2 is not trivial and requires some rules
that might not feel natural at first sight in the setup.  Writing a
book soon becomes a technically and mentally complex task, just like
developing a software system. For the latter people have invented a
lot of sophisticated technologies and best practices to deal with the
complexity. The present setup for books is a similar collection of my
own technologies and best practices, developed from writing
thousands of pages. In particular, the setup has been successfully
used for the large-scale 900-page Springer book "A Primer on
Scientific Programming with Python" [Ref1]_ (individual
chapters of this book, e.g. [Ref2]_, can be
examined online in various ebook formats) as well as for
`books in the works <http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/index.html>`__.

To use this setup, just clone the `repository <https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce>`__ and you have the
directory structure, the scripts, and example files to get started with
a book project at
once! The source files for this book (especially in
``doc/src/chapters/rules``) constitute nice demonstrations for learning
about basic and advanced DocOnce writing techniques.
